### Specs

The spec suite is a work in progress.  Existing specs can either be run
using [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) or rake.

Guard

    $ bundle exec guard

Rake

    $ rake spec

We use [VCR](https://www.relishapp.com/myronmarston/vcr/docs) to stub
out and save http interactions.  Cassettes are not stored in the repo.
They are generated the first time the spec suite is run and stored in
spec/cassettes.  To clear them and regenerate:

    $ rm -rf spec/cassettes


### Issues

All issues should be documented at
[balanced-ruby/issues](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-ruby/issues)


### Scenarios

####Render

To render executable files from scenario templates run `rake render_executables`
Check /scenarios and make sure each scenario has an executable.rb file

####Delete

To delete previously generated executable files run `rake delete_executables`

####Test

After generating executable files, make sure they are valid Ruby files by running
 `rspec scenarios/execute.rb` from the root directory

### Troubleshooting

#####OpenSSL
    SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError)

The machine's Ruby/OpenSSL environment can't find any root certificates to trust. Please refer [here](http://www.google.com/search?q=SSL+connect+returned=1+errno=0+state=SSLv3) to find the best solution for your environment.
